# go-service
## Introduction
The go-service library is a set of Go packages to build simple and efficient
server software.

## Licensing
Go-service is open source software distributed under the
[ISC](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC) license.

## Contributions
### Open source, not open contribution
[Similar to SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html), go-service is open
source but not open contribution for multiple reasons:

- It avoids potential intellectual property and licensing issues.
- It removes the burden of reviewing patches and maintaining the resulting
  code.
- It helps keeping the software focused on a clear vision.

While this might be disappointing to you, this choice helps me continue to
build and maintain go-service.

### Bug reporting
I am thankful for any bug report. Feel free to open issues and include as much
useful information as possible. I cannot however guarantee that I will fix
every bug.

### Ideas and feature suggestions
Ideas about current systems and suggestions for new ones are welcome, either
on GitHub discussions or by [email](mailto:nicolas@n16f.net).

You can also [hire me](mailto:nicolas@exograd.com) for support or to develop
specific features.
